<h2>Who made this?</h2>
<p>This site was designed by me, <a href="http://www.laurenhallden.com/" target="blank">Lauren Hallden</a>.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>When life hands you online dating, make online-dating internet weirdness.<br>(I had some free time and I thought it would be funny.)</p>


<h2>Where's the text from?</h2>
<p>The regular text is made of phrases I see frequently on OkCupid. My matches are your average 20/30-something mid-Atlantic straight guys, so the text I'm working with is borrowed from them.</p>
<p>Yes, I realize that means I'm not being completely inclusive here. Feel free to send me the frequent responses of other demographics!</p>
<p>On second thought, don't. My eyes are bleeding as it is.</p>

<h2>Is the crazy text real?</h2>
<p>Awww, you haven't tried online dating yet, have you. That's cute. You're lucky.</p>
